# PythonMIPS

The full extent of this project is not known. As of right now I intend to make a program that can take in an 8 digit hexidecimal number and return the appropriate line of MIPS code and eventually to also do the reverse.

This project is being made in Python 3.6.8. Project started: 24 Jan 2020

# Hex to MIPS
- Basic R-type instructions like 'add' & 'or' implemented (formatting not entirely implemented) 27 Jan 2020
- Basic I-type instructions like 'addi' & 'sw' implemented (formatting not entirely implemented) 28 Jan 2020
