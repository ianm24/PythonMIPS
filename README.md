# PythonMIPS

The full extent of this project is not known. As of right now I intend to make a program that can take in an 8 digit hexidecimal number and return the appropriate line of MIPS code and eventually to also do the reverse.

This project is being made in Python 3.6.8. Project started: 24 Jan 2020
